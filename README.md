# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Front Page

In the project directory, I have created simple interface for shopping mall:

### Cart Checkout

After clicking AddtoCart, the selected items will be stored in the cart and the user can access by clicking on the top right icon.

The cart interface will be looked like this

### Function for Checkout

In the cart section, users can easily edit the number of desired item by clicking the + or - for the number. Furthermore, user can also remove the selected item by clicking the Remove button.

The price of all items will be updated immediately after the change in the number of items.
